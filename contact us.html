<p>Welcome to the contact us page. Rapping is the way of expression feelings through music. Music is the number one problem solver or coping skill people use, When something is going wrong or they need a idea that will help with anger. The idea of music isin't just to get to know the words or to just listen to, It has a very inflencing meaning to it. I want to be a rapper and that is my number one goal. I have always desired rapping a young rapper named Youngboy Never Broke Again or NBA Youngboy, also know by the name of Kentrell DeSean Gaulden from the city of Baton Rouge, LA. Some of his music i can relate to and he is letting me know that through his music Nothing Is Impossible. Music can also be a way of inspiring other people, or even inspiring other people to do good things. Rapping is an achieveable career, and anyone can succeed at it.<a href="https://www.raps.org › careers" target="_blank">Rapping Careers</a>© 2019.</p>
